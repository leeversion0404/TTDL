# TikTok Downloader 1.0 for Windows (and possibly mac)

**TikTokDL**
TikTokDL is a TikTok Video Downloader developed with [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29) & [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/). The current features of the application is limited.

I was initially working on a multi SoMe Video-Downloader, but I decided to split it in multiple parts, hence the reason why this repo does not have many commits (I just ported the TikTok part out of that other app I was making).

More features will be added gradually and below you can find a list of stuff I am working on or have already done. Currently the application does not use any webscraping, but it will be added soon to scrape data about TikTok profiles and to download multi-profile videos at once and so on.

### The current To-Do-List for TikTokDL.
- [x] TikTok Video Downloading
- [x] TikTok Metadata Loading
- [ ] Download Cover image
- [ ] Choose download server
- [ ] Import Multi-Download Json / .txt file
- [ ] Export Json Video Data (The button exists..)
- [ ] Multi (Bulk) Download videos from profiles
- [ ] Option to choose whether you want to download with or without watermarks

### General Improvements
- [ ] Settings Panel
- [ ] Download Folder Selection
- [ ] Multi-List Creation View
